## Why does the `SinglyLinkedList` contains a `Node` class inside of it?

Please provide a response to this question.

A SinglyLinkedList contains nodes because a singly linked list is full of nodes that contain the current position, the data inside it, and the next nodes location. The singly linked lists only go unidirectional so the nodes help you move fluidly between eachother.

## Why is the `Node` class "nested" inside of the `SinglyLinkedList<E>`?

Please provide a response to this question.

The node class is nested inside the SinglyLinkedList<E> because this is where you configure the node to work with the singlylinkedlist. when it is nested like this it is easier to call and use the data stored in the list.

## For the chosen input sizes, what is the efficiency of `toString`? Use both the results of your experiments and big Oh notation.

Please provide a response to this question.

## For the chosen input sizes, what is the efficiency of your implemented recursive method? Use both the results of your experiments and big Oh notation.

Please provide a response to this question.

## After completing this assignment, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practice the implementation of more complex algorithms into my programs. Complex algorithms are the crux of increadibly impressive and interesting programs spanning from Artificial intelligence to operating systems and they can be seen truly in every digital aspect of every day life. The ability to not only understand but excel in the creation and implementation of algorithms is the foundation of becoming a well rounded computer scientist.

## What challenges did you face during this assignment? How did you handle them?

It is challenging to figure out how to effectively build algorithms that handle the data given them and are able to run with the ideal effenciency. As with any new mathmatic subject, these algorithms will take practice to understand, yet after enough work, they will be easy to formulate and make efficient.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

I am definently greatful for the ability to learn about how to optimize algorithms. Algorithm optimization is crucial in building an intricite, efficient, and user friendly program. It is great to know that there are means of optimization and testing that optimization.
